`-i` means show http response headers
`-H` allows you to set http request headers. And drupal services need just the content-type header
`-c` is to save the cookies on the cookies.txt file. And since we are doing a login this is important
`-d` allows you to set the request body, which you will be using on drupal services to send the parameters
